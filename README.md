The organization described here reminds me of the more Scientology-like aspects of our company. I realize that technically powerful sedition is an ideal for many people, but I think it's harmful to the well-being of its adherents.
 
The only thing that's appealing in all this is the portrayal of deep competence in a sufficiently complex system of knowledge. Too bad the system of knowledge portrayed is a fake one, instead of something important like algorithmic efficiency or Sogdian grammar or the cooking properties of different kinds of oil.

Max Barry writes, "The story of Babel isn't about hubris. It's about language" (Part 3, Chapter Three, p. 275). That's a misreading. If you read the full nine verses of Genesis 11, it is clear that God's goal is to disrupt the building of the city and the tower, which He regards as arrogant.
 
The Biblical story has Akkadian antecedents involving ritual surrounding the construction of Babylon's temple Esagila ("the structure with up-raised head;" cf. Babel's "tower with its top in the sky"). Of course the tower and its disruption are the key focus of the Genesis story. Ramifying language is merely how God achieves that disruption.
 
I can imagine that Barry's view of the story as being "about language" may owe something to his reading Australian dream-time myth. The example he gives of Minnawara and the origin of the kangaroo (Part 2, Chapter Four, p. 193) is also not just an "origin of" story but a lesson about stubbornness. It's common for origin stories to include a moral element beyond merely describing where something comes from — not only where but why.

I am glad I read the book; I would not have done so without the pressure of the Fiction Reading Club and the knowledge that I was leaving our company at the end of the month.
 
But although I enjoyed reading the book, what I enjoyed most was finishing it — about a third of the way through I decided I didn't actually like the story, but I felt good about persisting until I finished it.
 
I dislike stories that rely on black magic for deus ex machina effects. There is only one kind of black magic in the world: the very notion that black magic exists at all. Once you introduce it, your two main options are to show it triumphant or to show it failing through the arrogance of its practitioners.
